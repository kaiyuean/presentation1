## collections

A collection — sometimes called a container — is simply an object that groups multiple elements into a single unit. Collections are used to store, retrieve, manipulate, and communicate aggregate data.

* Interfaces: Set, List, Queue, Deque, Map, Object Ordering, Sortedset, SortedMap.
*  Implementations: Implementations are the data objects used to store collections, which implement the interfaces.
* Aggregate Operations: Enable you to write more concise and efficient code that process elements stored in collections.
* Algorithms: the polymorphic algorithms provided by the JDK to operate on collections.
* Custom Implementations
* Interoperability: How the Collections Framework interoperates with older APIs that predate the addition of Collections to Java.
