## Relationship between java and the field of software engineering

The process of software engineering includes requirements, system analysis, system design, code design, testing, deployment, maintenance. Java is one of the most popular programming languages related to the field of code design.

## Why software developers care about this topic?

Java is one of the most popular programming languages used to create web applications and platforms. It was designed for flexibility, allowing developers to write code that would run on any machine, regardless of architecture or platform.

Java differs from other programming languages in a couple of significant ways. The following sections describe the most important differences.

### Platform Independence

One of the main reasons Java is so popular is its platform independence, which means that Java programs can be run on many different types of computers. A Java program runs on any computer with a Java Runtime Environment, also known as a JRE, installed. 

### Object Orientation

Java is inherently object-oriented, which means that Java programs are made up of programming elements called objects. Simply put, an object is a programming entity that represents either some real-world object or an abstract concept.

### The Java API

The Java language itself is very simple. However, Java comes with a library of classes that provide commonly used utility functions that most Java programs can't do without. This class library, called the Java API, is as much a part of Java as the language itself. The Java API has several thousand classes â€” with tens of thousands of methods you can use in your programs.
